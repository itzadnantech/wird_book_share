Behold!, there came messengers to it.When We (first) sent to them two messengers, they rejected them: But We strengthened them with a third: they said, “Truly, we have been sent on a mission to you.”The (people) said: “Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie.”They said: “Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you:“And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message.”The (people) said: “for us, we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not, we will certainly stone you. And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us.”They said: “Your evil omens are with yourselves: (deem ye this an evil omen). If ye are admonished? Nay, but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!”Then there came running, from the farthest part of the City, a man, saying, “O my people! Obey the messengers:“Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves), and who have themselves received Guidance.“It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me, and to Whom ye shall (all) be brought back.“Shall I take (other) gods besides Him? If (Allah) Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me, of no use whatever will be their intercession for me, nor can they deliver me.“I would indeed, if I were to do so, be in manifest Error.“For me, I have faith in the Lord of you (all): listen, then, to me!”It was said: “Enter thou the Garden.” He said: “Ah me! Would that my People knew (what I know)!-“For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honour!”And We sent not down against his People, after him, any hosts from heaven, nor was it needful for Us so to do.It was no more than a single mighty Blast, and behold! they were (like ashes) quenched and silent.Ah! Alas for (My) Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him!See they not how many generations before them we destroyed? Not to them will they return:But each one of them all – will be brought before Us (for judgment).A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and produce grain therefrom, of which ye do eat.And We produce therein orchard with date-palms and vines, and We cause springs to gush forth therein:That they may enjoy the fruits of this (artistry): It was not their hands that made this: will they not then give thanks? Glory to Allah, Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces, as well as their own (human) kind and (other) things of which they have no knowledge.And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day, and behold they are plunged in darkness;And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is the decree of (Him), the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing.And the Moon,- We have measured for her mansions (to traverse) till she returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk.It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law).And a Sign for them is that We bore their race (through the Flood) in the loaded Ark;And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride.If it were Our Will, We could drown them: then would there be no helper (to hear their cry), nor could they be delivered,Except by way of Mercy from Us, and by way of (world) convenience (to serve them) for a time.When they are told, “Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you, in order that ye may receive Mercy,” (they turn back).Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away therefrom.And when they are told, “Spend ye of (the bounties) with which Allah has provided you,” the Unbelievers say to those who believe: “Shall we then feed those whom, if Allah had so willed, He would have fed, (Himself)?- Ye are in nothing but manifest error.” Further, they say, “When will this promise (come to pass), if what ye say is true?”They will not (have to) wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves! No (chance) will they then have, by will, to dispose (of their affairs), nor to return to their own people! The trumpet shall be sounded, when behold! from the sepulchres (men) will rush forth to their Lord! They will say: “Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose?”… (A voice will say:) “This is what (Allah) Most Gracious had promised. And true was the word of the messengers!” It will be no more than a single Blast, when lo! they will all be brought up before Us!Then, on that Day, not a soul will be wronged in the least, and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds. Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that they do; They and their associates will be in groves of (cool) shade, reclining on Thrones (of dignity); (Every) fruit (enjoyment) will be there for them; they shall have whatever they call for; “Peace!” – a word (of salutation) from a Lord Most Merciful! “And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day! “Did I not enjoin on you, O ye Children of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan; for that he was to you an enemy avowed?- “And that ye should worship Me, (for that) this was the Straight Way? “But he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did ye not, then, understand? “This is the Hell of which ye were (repeatedly) warned! “Embrace ye the (fire) this Day, for that ye (persistently) rejected (Truth).” That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths. But their hands will speak to us, and their feet bear witness, to all that they did. If it had been our Will, We could surely have blotted out their eyes; then should they have run about groping for the Path, but how could they have seen? And if it had been Our Will, We could have transformed them (to remain) in their places; then should they have been unable to move about, nor could they have returned (after error).If We grant long life to any, We cause him to be reversed in nature: Will they not then understand? We have not instructed the (Prophet) in Poetry, nor is it meet for him: this is no less than a Message and a Qur´an making things clear: That it may give admonition to any (who are) alive, and that the charge may be proved against those who reject (Truth).See they not that it is We Who have created for them – among the things which Our hands have fashioned – cattle, which are under their dominion?-And that We have subjected them to their (use)? of them some do carry them and some they eat:And they have (other) profits from them (besides), and they get (milk) to drink. Will they not then be grateful? Yet they take (for worship) gods other than Allah, (hoping) that they might be helped!They have not the power to help them: but they will be brought up (before Our Judgment-seat) as a troop (to be condemned).Let not their speech, then, grieve thee. Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose.Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm? yet behold! he (stands forth) as an open adversary! And he makes comparisons for Us, and forgets his own (origin and) Creation: He says, “Who can give life to (dry) bones and decomposed ones (at that)?”Say, “He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He is Well-versed in every kind of creation!- “The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold! ye kindle therewith (your own fires)! “Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like thereof?” – Yea, indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme, of skill and knowledge (infinite)! Verily, when He intends a thing, His Command is, “be”, and it is! So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things: and to Him will ye be all brought back.",

And they used to say, “What! when we die and become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised up again? “(We) and our fathers of old?” Say: “Yea, those of old and those of later times, “All will certainly be gathered together for the meeting appointed for a Day well known. “Then will ye truly,- O ye that go wrong, and treat (Truth) as Falsehood!- “Ye will surely taste of the Tree of Zaqqum. “Then will ye fill your insides there with, “And drink Boiling Water on top of it: “Indeed ye shall drink like diseased camels raging with thirst!” Such will be their entertainment on the Day of Requital! It is We Who have created you: why will ye not witness the Truth? Do ye then see?- The (human Seed) that ye throw out,- Is it ye who create it, or are We the Creators? We have decreed Death to be your common lot, and We are not to be frustrated from changing your Forms and creating you (again) in (forms) that ye know not.And ye certainly know already the first form of creation: why then do ye not celebrate His praises? See ye the seed that ye sow in the ground? Is it ye that cause it to grow, or are We the Cause? Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry powder, and ye would be left in wonderment, (Saying), “We are indeed left with debts (for nothing): “Indeed are we shut out (of the fruits of our labour)” See ye the water which ye drink? Do ye bring it down (in rain) from the cloud or do We? Were it Our Will, We could make it salt (and unpalatable): then why do ye not give thanks? See ye the Fire which ye kindle? Is it ye who grow the tree which feeds the fire, or do We grow it? We have made it a memorial (of Our handiwork), and an article of comfort and convenience for the denizens of deserts. Then celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme! Furthermore I call to witness the setting of the Stars,- And that is indeed a mighty adjuration if ye but knew,- That this is indeed a qur´an Most Honourable, In Book well-guarded, Which none shall touch but those who are clean: A Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. Is it such a Message that ye would hold in light esteem? And have ye made it your livelihood that ye should declare it false? Then why do ye not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying man) reaches the throat,- And ye the while (sit) looking on,- But We are nearer to him than ye, and yet see not,- Then why do ye not,- If you are exempt from (future) account,- Call back the soul, if ye are true (in the claim of independence)? Thus, then, if he be of those Nearest to Allah, (There is for him) Rest and Satisfaction, and a Garden of Delights. And if he be of the Companions of the Right Hand, (For him is the salutation), “Peace be unto thee”, from the Companions of the Right Hand. And if he be of those who treat (Truth) as Falsehood, who go wrong, For him is Entertainment with Boiling Water. And burning in Hell-Fire. Verily, this is the Very Truth and Certainly. So celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme. (Surah Waqiah)",

And the Companions of the Left Hand,- what will be the Companions of the Left Hand? And those Foremost (in Faith) will be Foremost (in the Hereafter).These will be those Nearest to Allah: In Gardens of Bliss: A number of people from those of old, And a few from those of later times. (They will be) on Thrones encrusted (with gold and precious stones), Reclining on them, facing each other. Round about them will (serve) youths of perpetual (freshness), With goblets, (shining) beakers, and cups (filled) out of clear-flowing fountains No after-ache will they receive therefrom, nor will they suffer intoxication: And with fruits, any that they may select: And the flesh of fowls, any that they may desire. And (there will be Companions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes,- Like unto Pearls well-guarded. A Reward for the deeds of their past (life). Not frivolity will they hear therein, nor any taint of ill,- Only the saying, “Peace! Peace”. The Companions of the Right Hand,- what will be the Companions of the Right Hand? (They will be) among Lote-trees without thorns, Among Talh trees with flowers (or fruits) piled one above another,- In shade long-extended, By water flowing constantly, And fruit in abundance.Whose season is not limited, nor (supply) forbidden, And on Thrones (of Dignity), raised high. We have created (their Companions) of special creation. And made them virgin – pure (and undefiled), – Beloved (by nature), equal in age,- For the Companions of the Right Hand. A (goodly) number from those of old, And a (goodly) number from those of later times. The Companions of the Left Hand,- what will be the Companions of the Left Hand? (They will be) in the midst of a Fierce Blast of Fire and in Boiling Water, And in the shades of Black Smoke: Nothing (will there be) to refresh, nor to please: For that they were wont to be indulged, before that, in wealth (and luxury), And persisted obstinately in wickedness supreme! And they used to say, “What! when we die and become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised up again? “(We) and our fathers of old?” Say: “Yea, those of old and those of later times, “All will certainly be gathered together for the meeting appointed for a Day well known. “Then will ye truly,- O ye that go wrong, and treat (Truth) as Falsehood!- “Ye will surely taste of the Tree of Zaqqum. “Then will ye fill your insides there with, “And drink Boiling Water on top of it: “Indeed ye shall drink like diseased camels raging with thirst!” Such will be their entertainment on the Day of Requital! It is We Who have created you: why will ye not witness the Truth? Do ye then see?- The (human Seed) that ye throw out,- Is it ye who create it, or are We the Creators? We have decreed Death to be your common lot, and We are not to be frustrated from changing your Forms and creating you (again) in (forms) that ye know not.And ye certainly know already the first form of creation: why then do ye not celebrate His praises? See ye the seed that ye sow in the ground? Is it ye that cause it to grow, or are We the Cause? Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry powder, and ye would be left in wonderment, (Saying), “We are indeed left with debts (for nothing): “Indeed are we shut out (of the fruits of our labour)” See ye the water which ye drink? Do ye bring it down (in rain) from the cloud or do We? Were it Our Will, We could make it salt (and unpalatable): then why do ye not give thanks? See ye the Fire which ye kindle? Is it ye who grow the tree which feeds the fire, or do We grow it? We have made it a memorial (of Our handiwork), and an article of comfort and convenience for the denizens of deserts. Then celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme! Furthermore I call to witness the setting of the Stars,- And that is indeed a mighty adjuration if ye but knew,- That this is indeed a qur´an Most Honourable, In Book well-guarded, Which none shall touch but those who are clean: A Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. Is it such a Message that ye would hold in light esteem? And have ye made it your livelihood that ye should declare it false? Then why do ye not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying man) reaches the throat,- And ye the while (sit) looking on,- But We are nearer to him than ye, and yet see not,- Then why do ye not,- If you are exempt from (future) account,- Call back the soul, if ye are true (in the claim of independence)? Thus, then, if he be of those Nearest to Allah, (There is for him) Rest and Satisfaction, and a Garden of Delights. And if he be of the Companions of the Right Hand, (For him is the salutation), “Peace be unto thee”, from the Companions of the Right Hand. And if he be of those who treat (Truth) as Falsehood, who go wrong, For him is Entertainment with Boiling Water. And burning in Hell-Fire. Verily, this is the Very Truth and Certainly. So celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme. (Surah Waqiah)",

You will never see any imperfection in the creation of the Most Compassionate.1 So look again: do you see any flaws?Then look again and again—your sight will return frustrated and weary.And indeed, We adorned the lowest heaven with ˹stars like˺ lamps, and made them ˹as missiles˺ for stoning ˹eavesdropping˺ devils, for whom We have also prepared the torment of the Blaze.Those who disbelieve in their Lord will suffer the punishment of Hell. What an evil destination! When they are tossed into it, they will hear its roaring as it boils over,almost bursting in fury. Every time a group is cast into it, its keepers will ask them, “Did a warner not come to you?” They will reply, “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said, ‘Allah has revealed nothing. You are extremely astray.’”And they will lament, “If only we had listened and reasoned, we would not be among the residents of the Blaze!” And so they will confess their sins. So away with the residents of the Blaze! Indeed, those in awe of their Lord without seeing Him will have forgiveness and a mighty reward.Whether you speak secretly or openly—He surely knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.How could He not know His Own creation? For He ˹alone˺ is the Most Subtle, All-Aware.He is the One Who smoothed out the earth for you, so move about in its regions and eat from His provisions. And to Him is the resurrection ˹of all˺.Do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up as it quakes violently?Or do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not unleash upon you a storm of stones. Only then would you know how ˹serious˺ My warning was!And certainly those before them denied ˹as well˺, then how severe was My response!Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading and folding their wings? None holds them up except the Most Compassionate. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of everything.Also, which ˹powerless˺ force will come to your help instead of the Most Compassionate? Indeed, the disbelievers are only ˹lost˺ in delusion.Or who is it that will provide for you if He withholds His provision? In fact, they persist in arrogance and aversion ˹to the truth˺.Who is ˹rightly˺ guided: the one who crawls facedown or the one who walks upright on the Straight Path?Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He is the One Who brought you into being and gave you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks.”˹Also˺ say, “He is the One Who has dispersed you ˹all˺ over the earth, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be gathered.”˹Still˺ they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “That knowledge is with Allah alone, and I am only sent with a clear warning.”Then when they see the torment drawing near, the faces of the disbelievers will become gloomy, and it will be said ˹to them˺, “This is what you claimed would never come.”Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider this: whether Allah causes me and those with me to die or shows us mercy, who will save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?”Say, “He is the Most Compassionate—in Him ˹alone˺ we believe, and in Him ˹alone˺ we trust. You will soon know who is clearly astray.”Say, “Consider this: if your water were to sink ˹into the earth˺, then who ˹else˺ could bring you flowing water?”",

  "wird_id_8_7_1": "Ya Sin.By the Qur´an, full of Wisdom,-Thou art indeed one of the messengers,On a Straight Way.It is a Revelation sent down by (Him), the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful.In order that thou mayest admonish a people, whose fathers had received no admonition, and who therefore remain heedless (of the Signs of Allah).The Word is proved true against the greater part of them: for they do not believe.We have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins, so that their heads are forced up (and they cannot see).And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them, and further, We have covered them up; so that they cannot see.The same is it to them whether thou admonish them or thou do not admonish them: they will not believe.Thou canst but admonish such a one as follows the Message and fears the (Lord) Most Gracious, unseen: give such a one, therefore, good tidings, of Forgiveness and a Reward most generous.Verily We shall give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before and that which they leave behind, and of all things have We taken account in a clear Book (of evidence).Set forth to them, by way of a parable, the (story of) the Companions of the City. Behold!, there came messengers to it.When We (first) sent to them two messengers, they rejected them: But We strengthened them with a third: they said, “Truly, we have been sent on a mission to you.”The (people) said: “Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie.”They said: “Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you:“And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message.”The (people) said: “for us, we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not, we will certainly stone you. And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us.”They said: “Your evil omens are with yourselves: (deem ye this an evil omen). If ye are admonished? Nay, but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!”Then there came running, from the farthest part of the City, a man, saying, “O my people! Obey the messengers:“Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves), and who have themselves received Guidance.“It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me, and to Whom ye shall (all) be brought back.“Shall I take (other) gods besides Him? If (Allah) Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me, of no use whatever will be their intercession for me, nor can they deliver me.“I would indeed, if I were to do so, be in manifest Error.“For me, I have faith in the Lord of you (all): listen, then, to me!”It was said: “Enter thou the Garden.” He said: “Ah me! Would that my People knew (what I know)!-“For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honour!”And We sent not down against his People, after him, any hosts from heaven, nor was it needful for Us so to do.It was no more than a single mighty Blast, and behold! they were (like ashes) quenched and silent.Ah! Alas for (My) Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him!See they not how many generations before them we destroyed? Not to them will they return:But each one of them all – will be brought before Us (for judgment).A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and produce grain therefrom, of which ye do eat.And We produce therein orchard with date-palms and vines, and We cause springs to gush forth therein:That they may enjoy the fruits of this (artistry): It was not their hands that made this: will they not then give thanks? Glory to Allah, Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces, as well as their own (human) kind and (other) things of which they have no knowledge.And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day, and behold they are plunged in darkness;And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is the decree of (Him), the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing.And the Moon,- We have measured for her mansions (to traverse) till she returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk.It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law).And a Sign for them is that We bore their race (through the Flood) in the loaded Ark;And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride.If it were Our Will, We could drown them: then would there be no helper (to hear their cry), nor could they be delivered,Except by way of Mercy from Us, and by way of (world) convenience (to serve them) for a time.When they are told, “Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you, in order that ye may receive Mercy,” (they turn back).Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away therefrom.And when they are told, “Spend ye of (the bounties) with which Allah has provided you,” the Unbelievers say to those who believe: “Shall we then feed those whom, if Allah had so willed, He would have fed, (Himself)?- Ye are in nothing but manifest error.” Further, they say, “When will this promise (come to pass), if what ye say is true?”They will not (have to) wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves! No (chance) will they then have, by will, to dispose (of their affairs), nor to return to their own people! The trumpet shall be sounded, when behold! from the sepulchres (men) will rush forth to their Lord! They will say: “Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose?”… (A voice will say:) “This is what (Allah) Most Gracious had promised. And true was the word of the messengers!” It will be no more than a single Blast, when lo! they will all be brought up before Us!Then, on that Day, not a soul will be wronged in the least, and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds. Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that they do; They and their associates will be in groves of (cool) shade, reclining on Thrones (of dignity); (Every) fruit (enjoyment) will be there for them; they shall have whatever they call for; “Peace!” – a word (of salutation) from a Lord Most Merciful! “And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day! “Did I not enjoin on you, O ye Children of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan; for that he was to you an enemy avowed?- “And that ye should worship Me, (for that) this was the Straight Way? “But he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did ye not, then, understand? “This is the Hell of which ye were (repeatedly) warned! “Embrace ye the (fire) this Day, for that ye (persistently) rejected (Truth).” That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths. But their hands will speak to us, and their feet bear witness, to all that they did. If it had been our Will, We could surely have blotted out their eyes; then should they have run about groping for the Path, but how could they have seen? And if it had been Our Will, We could have transformed them (to remain) in their places; then should they have been unable to move about, nor could they have returned (after error).If We grant long life to any, We cause him to be reversed in nature: Will they not then understand? We have not instructed the (Prophet) in Poetry, nor is it meet for him: this is no less than a Message and a Qur´an making things clear: That it may give admonition to any (who are) alive, and that the charge may be proved against those who reject (Truth).See they not that it is We Who have created for them – among the things which Our hands have fashioned – cattle, which are under their dominion?-And that We have subjected them to their (use)? of them some do carry them and some they eat:And they have (other) profits from them (besides), and they get (milk) to drink. Will they not then be grateful? Yet they take (for worship) gods other than Allah, (hoping) that they might be helped!They have not the power to help them: but they will be brought up (before Our Judgment-seat) as a troop (to be condemned).Let not their speech, then, grieve thee. Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose.Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm? yet behold! he (stands forth) as an open adversary! And he makes comparisons for Us, and forgets his own (origin and) Creation: He says, “Who can give life to (dry) bones and decomposed ones (at that)?”Say, “He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He is Well-versed in every kind of creation!- “The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold! ye kindle therewith (your own fires)! “Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like thereof?” – Yea, indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme, of skill and knowledge (infinite)! Verily, when He intends a thing, His Command is, “be”, and it is! So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things: and to Him will ye be all brought back.",
  "wird_id_8_8_1": "All praise is for Allah Who has revealed the Book to His servant,1 allowing no crookedness in it, ˹making it˺ perfectly upright, to warn ˹the disbelievers˺ of a severe torment from Him; to give good news to the believers—who do good—that they will have a fine reward, in which they will remain forever; and to warn those who claim, “Allah has offspring.” They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers. What a terrible claim that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies. Now, perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their denial, if they ˹continue to˺ disbelieve in this message. We have indeed made whatever is on earth as an adornment for it, in order to test which of them is best in deeds. And We will certainly reduce whatever is on it to barren ground. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ thought that the people of the cave and the plaque1 were ˹the only˺ wonders of Our signs? ˹Remember˺ when those youths took refuge in the cave, and said, “Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.” So We caused them to fall into a dead sleep1 in the cave for many years, then We raised them so We may show which of the two groups would make a better estimation of the length of their stay. We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ their story in truth. They were youths who truly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance. And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.” ˹Then they said to one another,˺ “These people of ours have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not produce a clear proof of them? Who then does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah? Since you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship besides Allah, take refuge in the cave. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and accommodate you in your ordeal.” And you would have seen the sun, as it rose, inclining away from their cave to the right, and as it set, declining away from them to the left, while they lay in its open space.1 That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never find for them a guiding mentor. And you would have thought they were awake,1 though they were asleep. We turned them over, to the right and left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. Had you looked at them, you would have certainly fled away from them, filled with horror.And so We awakened them so that they might question one another. One of them exclaimed, “How long have you remained ˹asleep˺?” Some replied, “Perhaps a day, or part of a day.” They said ˹to one another˺, “Your Lord knows best how long you have remained. So send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him find which food is the purest, and then bring you provisions from it. Let him be ˹exceptionally˺ cautious, and do not let him give you away.For, indeed, if they find out about you, they will stone you ˹to death˺, or force you back into their faith, and then you will never succeed.” That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might know that Allah’s promise ˹of resurrection˺ is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour.1 When the people disputed with each other about the case of the youth ˹after their death˺,2 some proposed, “Build a structure around them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in the matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.” Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” ˹only˺ guessing blindly. And others will say, “They were seven and their dog was the eighth.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord knows best their ˹exact˺ number. Only a few people know as well.” So do not argue about them except with sure knowledge,1 nor consult any of those ˹who debate˺ about them. And never say of anything, “I will definitely do this tomorrow,” without adding, “if Allah so wills!” But if you forget, then remember your Lord, and say, “I trust my Lord will guide me to what is more right than this.” They had remained in their cave for three hundred years, adding nine.Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him ˹alone˺ is ˹the knowledge of˺ the unseen of the heavens and the earth. How perfectly He hears and sees! They have no guardian besides Him, and He shares His command with none.” Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His Words, nor can you find any refuge besides Him. And patiently stick with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure.1 Do not let your eyes look beyond them, desiring the luxuries of this worldly life. And do not obey those whose hearts We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follow ˹only˺ their desires and whose state is ˹total˺ loss. And say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹This is˺ the truth from your Lord. Whoever wills let them believe, and whoever wills let them disbelieve.” Surely We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will ˹completely˺ surround them. When they cry for aid, they will be aided with water like molten metal, which will burn ˹their˺ faces. What a horrible drink! And what a terrible place to rest! As for those who believe and do good, We certainly never deny the reward of those who are best in deeds.It is they who will have the Gardens of Eternity, with rivers flowing under their feet. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and wear green garments of fine silk and rich brocade, reclining there on ˹canopied˺ couches. What a marvellous reward! And what a fabulous place to rest!Give them ˹O Prophet˺ an example of two men. To ˹the disbelieving˺ one We gave two gardens of grapevines, which We surrounded with palm trees and placed ˹various˺ crops in between.Each garden yielded ˹all˺ its produce, never falling short. And We caused a river to flow between them.And he had other resources1 ˹as well˺. So he boasted to a ˹poor˺ companion of his, while conversing with him, “I am greater than you in wealth and superior in manpower.” And he entered his property, while wronging his soul, saying, “I do not think this will ever perish,nor do I think the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, I will definitely get a far better outcome than ˹all˺ this.” His ˹believing˺ companion replied, while conversing with him, “Do you disbelieve in the One Who created you from dust,1 then ˹developed you˺ from a sperm-drop, then formed you into a man? But as for me: He is Allah, my Lord, and I will never associate anyone with my Lord ˹in worship˺. If only you had said, upon entering your property, ‘This is what Allah has willed! There is no power except with Allah!’ Even though you see me inferior to you in wealth and offspring, perhaps my Lord will grant me ˹something˺ better than your garden, and send down upon your garden a thunderbolt from the sky, turning it into a barren waste.Or its water may sink ˹into the earth˺, and then you will never be able to seek it out.” And so all his produce was ˹totally˺ ruined, so he started to wring his hands for all he had spent on it, while it had collapsed on its trellises. He cried, “Alas! I wish I had never associated anyone with my Lord ˹in worship˺!” And he had no manpower to help him against Allah, nor could he ˹even˺ help himself.At this time, support comes ˹only˺ from Allah—the True ˹Lord˺. He is best in reward and best in outcome.And give them a parable of this worldly life. ˹It is˺ like the plants of the earth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky. Then they ˹soon˺ turn into chaff scattered by the wind. And Allah is fully capable of ˹doing˺ all things.Wealth and children are the adornment of this worldly life, but the everlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in reward and in hope.˹Beware of˺ the Day We will blow the mountains away, and you will see the earth laid bare. And We will gather all ˹humankind˺, leaving none behind.They will be presented before your Lord in rows, ˹and the deniers will be told,˺ “You have surely returned to Us ˹all alone˺ as We created you the first time, although you ˹always˺ claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.” And the record ˹of deeds˺ will be laid ˹open˺, and you will see the wicked in fear of what is ˹written˺ in it. They will cry, “Woe to us! What kind of record is this that does not leave any sin, small or large, unlisted?” They will find whatever they did present ˹before them˺. And your Lord will never wrong anyone.And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,1 who was one of the jinn, but he rebelled against the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants as patrons instead of Me, although they are your enemy? What an evil alternative for the wrongdoers ˹to choose˺! I never called them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth or ˹even˺ their own creation, nor would I take the misleaders as helpers.And ˹beware of˺ the Day He will say, “Call upon those you claimed were My associate-gods.” So they will call them, but will receive no response. And We will make them ˹all˺ share in the same doom. The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and will find no way to avoid it.We have surely set forth in this Quran every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people, but humankind is the most argumentative of all beings.And nothing prevents people from believing when guidance comes to them and from seeking their Lord’s forgiveness except ˹their demand˺ to meet the same fate of earlier deniers or that the torment would confront them face to face.We do not send the messengers except as deliverers of good news and warners. But the disbelievers argue in falsehood, ˹hoping˺ to discredit the truth with it, and make a mockery of My revelations and warnings.And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ invite them to ˹true˺ guidance, they will never be ˹rightly˺ guided.Your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to seize them ˹immediately˺ for what they commit, He would have certainly hastened their punishment. But they have an appointed time, from which they will find no refuge.Those ˹are the˺ societies We destroyed when they persisted in wrong,1 and We had set a time for their destruction.And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his young assistant, “I will never give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I travel for ages.” But when they ˹finally˺ reached the point where the seas met, they forgot their ˹salted˺ fish, and it made its way into the sea, slipping away ˹wondrously˺.When they had passed further, he said to his assistant, “Bring us our meal! We have certainly been exhausted by today’s journey.”He replied, “Do you remember when we rested by the rock? ˹That is when˺ I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except Satan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously.” Moses responded, “That is ˹exactly˺ what we were looking for.”1 So they returned, retracing their footsteps.There they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had granted mercy from Us and enlightened with knowledge of Our Own.Moses said to him, “May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?” He said, “You certainly cannot be patient ˹enough˺ with me.And how can you be patient with what is beyond your ˹realm of˺ knowledge?” Moses assured ˹him˺, “You will find me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.” He responded, “Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I ˹myself˺ clarify it for you.” So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole in it. Moses protested, “Have you done this to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing!” He replied, “Did I not say that you cannot have patience with me?” Moses pleaded, “Excuse me for forgetting, and do not be hard on me.” So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him. Moses protested, “Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one? You have certainly done a horrible thing.” He answered, “Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?” Moses replied, “If I ever question you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse.” So they moved on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for food, but the people refused to give them hospitality. There they found a wall ready to collapse, so the man set it right. Moses protested, “If you wanted, you could have demanded a fee for this.” He replied, “This is the parting of our ways. I will explain to you what you could not bear patiently.“As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people, working at sea. So I intended to damage it, for there was a ˹tyrant˺ king ahead of them who seizes every ˹good˺ ship by force.“And as for the boy, his parents were ˹true˺ believers, and we1 feared that he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief.So we hoped that their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his place.“And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under the wall was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord willed that these children should come of age and retrieve their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it ˹all˺ on my own. This is the explanation of what you could not bear patiently.” They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about Ⱬul-Qarnain. Say, “I will relate to you something of his narrative.” Surely We established him in the land, and gave him the means to all things.So he travelled a course,until he reached the setting ˹point˺ of the sun, which appeared to him to be setting in a spring of murky water, where he found some people. We said, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Either punish them or treat them kindly.” He responded, “Whoever does wrong will be punished by us, then will be returned to their Lord, Who will punish them with a horrible torment.As for those who believe and do good, they will have the finest reward, and we will assign them easy commands.” Then he travelled a ˹different˺ course until he reached the rising ˹point˺ of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it.So it was. And We truly had full knowledge of him.Then he travelled a ˹third˺ course until he reached ˹a pass˺ between two mountains. He found in front of them a people who could hardly understand ˹his˺ language.They pleaded, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Surely Gog and Magog1 are spreading corruption throughout the land. Should we pay you tribute, provided that you build a wall between us and them?” He responded, “What my Lord has provided for me is far better. But assist me with resources, and I will build a barrier between you and them. Bring me blocks of iron!” Then, when he had filled up ˹the gap˺ between the two mountains, he ordered, “Blow!” When the iron became red hot, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.” And so the enemies could neither scale nor tunnel through it.He declared, “This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will level it to the ground. And my Lord’s promise is ever true.” On that Day, We will let them1 surge ˹like waves˺ over one another. Later, the Trumpet will be blown,2 and We will gather all ˹people˺ together.On that Day We will display Hell clearly for the disbelievers,those who turned a blind eye to My Reminder1 and could not stand listening ˹to it˺.Do the disbelievers think they can ˹simply˺ take My servants1 as lords instead of Me? We have surely prepared Hell as an accommodation for the disbelievers.Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall we inform you of who will lose the most deeds? ˹They are˺ those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life, while they think they are doing good!” It is they who reject the signs of their Lord and their meeting with Him, rendering their deeds void, so We will not give their deeds any weight on Judgment Day.That is their reward: Hell, for their disbelief and mockery of My signs and messengers. Indeed, those who believe and do good will have the Gardens of Paradise1 as an accommodation,where they will be forever, never desiring anywhere else.Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the ocean were ink for ˹writing˺ the Words of my Lord, it would certainly run out before the Words of my Lord were finished, even if We refilled it with its equal.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a man like you, ˹but˺ it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God. So whoever hopes for the meeting with their Lord, let them do good deeds and associate none in the worship of their Lord.”       ",
  "wird_id_8_9_1": "Ḥâ-Mĩm.By the clear Book!Indeed, We sent it down on a blessed night, for We always warn ˹against evil˺.On that night every matter of wisdom is ordained by a command from Us, for We have always sent ˹messengers˺ as a mercy from your Lord. He ˹alone˺ is truly the All-Hearing, All-Knowing— the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, if only you had sure faith.There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He ˹alone˺ gives life and causes death. ˹He is˺ your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers.In fact, they are in doubt, amusing themselves.Wait then ˹O Prophet˺ for the day ˹when˺ the sky will be veiled in haze,1 clearly visible,overwhelming the people. ˹They will cry,˺ “This is a painful torment.Our Lord! Remove ˹this˺ torment from us, ˹and˺ we will certainly believe.” How can they be reminded when a messenger has already come to them, making things clear,then they turned away from him, saying, “A madman, taught by others!”? Indeed, We will remove ˹that˺ torment for a while, and you ˹Meccans˺ will return ˹to disbelief˺.˹Then˺ on the Day We will deal ˹you˺ the fiercest blow, We will surely inflict punishment.Indeed, before them We tested Pharaoh’s people: a noble messenger came to them,˹proclaiming,˺ “Hand over the servants of Allah to me.1 I am truly a trustworthy messenger to you.And do not be arrogant with Allah. I have certainly come to you with a compelling proof.And indeed, I seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord so you do not stone me ˹to death˺.˹But˺ if you do not believe me, then let me be.”Ultimately, he cried out to his Lord, “These are a wicked people!”˹Allah responded,˺ “Leave with My servants at night, for you will surely be pursued.And leave the sea parted, for they are certainly an army bound to drown.”˹Imagine˺ how many gardens and springs the tyrants1 left behind,as well as ˹various˺ crops and splendid residences,and luxuries which they fully enjoyed.So it was. And We awarded it ˹all˺ to another people.Neither heaven nor earth wept over them, nor was their fate delayed.And We certainly delivered the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment of Pharaoh. He was truly a tyrant, a transgressor.And indeed, We chose the Israelites knowingly above the others.And We showed them signs in which there was a clear test.Indeed, these ˹Meccans˺ say,“There is nothing beyond our first death, and we will never be resurrected.Bring ˹back˺ our forefathers, if what you say is true.” Are they superior to the people of Tubba’1 and those before them? We destroyed them ˹all˺, ˹for˺ they were truly wicked.We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between for sport.We only created them for a purpose, but most of these ˹pagans˺ do not know.Surely the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision is the time appointed for all— the Day no kith or kin will be of benefit to another whatsoever, nor will they be helped, except those shown mercy by Allah. He is truly the Almighty, Most Merciful. Surely ˹the fruit of˺ the tree of Zaqqûm1 will be the food of the evildoer.Like molten metal, it will boil in the bellies like the boiling of hot water. ˹It will be said,˺ “Seize them and drag them into the depths of the Hellfire. Then pour over their heads the torment of boiling water.” ˹The wicked will be told,˺ “Taste this. You mighty, noble one! This is truly what you ˹all˺ used to doubt.” Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place, amid Gardens and springs, dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing one another. So it will be. And We will pair them to maidens with gorgeous eyes. There they will call for every fruit in serenity. There they will never taste death, beyond the first death. And He will protect them from the punishment of the Hellfire— as ˹an act of˺ grace from your Lord. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph. Indeed, We have made this ˹Quran˺ easy in your own language ˹O Prophet˺ so perhaps they will be mindful. Wait then! They too are certainly waiting.",
